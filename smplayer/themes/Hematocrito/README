This is the Hematocrito skin for Mplayer. Hematocrito is a GTK+ Theme created by Martin Césare.

This skin was created by Martin Césare (http://martincesare.com.ar) 

Fonts are from the work by Nikola Pizurica (pizurica@neobee.net)
The "skin" file is the one from the ClearPlayer skin by mxt (http://rethor.no-ip.org/mxt) 
with a small retouch to serve my needs.
